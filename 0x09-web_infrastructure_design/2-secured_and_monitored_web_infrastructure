## Explanation of Specifics

### For every additional element, why you are adding it

- **Explanation:** Three new components have been added: a firewall for each server to protect against potential attacks and exploitation, an SSL certificate for serving www.foobar.com over HTTPS, and three monitoring clients responsible for collecting logs and sending them to our data collector, Sumologic.

### What are firewalls for

- **Explanation:** A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network.

### Why is the traffic served over HTTPS

- **Explanation:** Traffic is now served over HTTPS instead of HTTP to ensure security. Unlike HTTP, which transfers data in plain text, HTTPS encrypts data using Transport Layer Security (TLS), thereby enhancing security.

### What monitoring is used for

- **Explanation:** Monitoring facilitates the proactive detection and diagnosis of web application performance issues, allowing for timely resolution.

### How the monitoring tool is collecting data

- **Explanation:** The monitoring tool collects logs from the application server, MySQL Database, and Nginx web server. In computing, logs are automatically generated and time-stamped records of events relevant to a specific system.

### Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS

- **Explanation:** To monitor web server QPS (Queries Per Second), network and application-level monitoring would be employed, especially considering that one web server handles 1K queries per second.

## Identified Issues

### Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue

- **Issue:** Terminating SSL at the load balancer level can be resource and CPU intensive due to decryption processes.  While this approach offloads decryption burden from servers, it may strain load balancer resources. However, the specific issue regarding this setup is currently unclear and requires further investigation.

### Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue

- **Issue:** Relying on a single MySQL server for write operations poses a risk of downtime and data loss. If this server goes down, the application features requiring write access will be affected, potentially leading to service disruptions.

### Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and
application server) might be a problem

- **Issue:** Having servers with identical components (database, web server, and application server) may lead to issues. If a bug arises in one component of a server, it would likely affect other servers as well, posing a challenge for maintaining system stability and integrity.

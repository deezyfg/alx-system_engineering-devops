## Explanation of Specifics

### What is a server

- **Explanation:** A server is a computer system or program that provides functionality for other programs or devices, known as clients.

### What is the role of the domain name

- **Explanation:** A domain name is a human-readable label that is used to identify and locate resources on the internet. It serves as the address for websites, allowing users to access them using familiar and easy-to-remember names instead of numerical IP addresses.

### What type of DNS record `www` is in `www.foobar.com`

- **Explanation:** The DNS record for www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. It aliases the www subdomain to the main domain foobar.com, allowing the website to be accessed using both www and non-www versions of the domain.

### What is the role of the web server

- **Explanation:** The web server's role is to handle HTTP requests from clients and serve web content, such as HTML files, images, and CSS stylesheets. 

### What is the role of the application server

- **Explanation:** The application server hosts the application codebase and is responsible for processing business logic, executing application code, and generating dynamic content by executing server-side code such as JSP, Ajax,
PHP, etc. in response to client requests. It communicates with the web server to fulfill user requests.

### What is the role of the database

- **Explanation:** The database stores and manages the data required by the application. It serves as a persistent storage mechanism for storing user data, application settings, and other information.

### What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website

- **Explanation:** The server communicates with users' computers over the internet using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocols. When a user requests a website, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which responds with the requested web content.

## Identified Issues

### Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

- **Issue:** The current infrastructure is vulnerable to a Single Point of Failure (SPOF), meaning that if the server experiences a failure, the entire website becomes inaccessible. This lack of redundancy poses a significant risk, potentially resulting in extended periods of downtime and hindering user access to the website.

### Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted):

- **Issue:** The downtime period might exceed expectations because the server relies on a single codebase that may not be available at that time. Users may encounter interruptions or delays when accessing the website during maintenance activities.

### Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic:

- **Issue:** The infrastructure may encounter difficulty in effectively managing increased traffic, especially during peak periods or sudden surges. This is because the domain name directs traffic directly to the server without utilizing a load balancer, which would help distribute the load. Consequently, the high volume of users accessing the website's content could result in a suboptimal user experience or restrict the website's capacity to accommodate users.

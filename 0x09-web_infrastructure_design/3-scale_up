## Explanation of Specifics

### For every additional element, why you are adding it

- **Explanation:** We have added one server and one load balancer. The addition of the new server allows for the separation of each component (web server: Nginx, application server: code base, and database: MySQL) onto separate servers, while also maintaining an extra server with all components to act as a backup in case of any component or server failure. Each server is equipped with monitoring capabilities and a firewall to ensure system security. Moreover, the addition of an extra load balancer assists in efficiently handling increased traffic across the entire infrastructure.
